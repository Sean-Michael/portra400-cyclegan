# portra400-cyclegan

## Overview

This project is my attempt at training a cycleGAN machine learning model to recreate the portra 400 film effect on digital photographs. My goal is to transform an image by applying a filter that mimics the color reproduction of portra 400 and some of the grain inherint in the 35mm film format.

## Training Data

To train the model I will be using a collection of my own 35mm film photographs, primarily shot on portra 400 or 800.
